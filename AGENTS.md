## Current focus: AI fundamentals refresher
- This workspace is dedicated to the “AI basic dive and refresher” journey.
- The flagship projects span the full set of labs, starting with `projects/00_pytorch_warmup` (Labs 0–6: MLP → CNN → utilities → Transformer → pretrained → detection → scripting/tooling) and guided by the checklist in that lab-centric `README.md`.
- Supporting directories (`data`, `models`, `notebooks`, `results`, `utils`) track datasets, reusable models, experiments, outputs, and shared utilities respectively.

## How to help
- Read `projects/00_pytorch_warmup/README.md` first to see the current lab checklist and immediate objectives before jumping into code.
- Reference `LEARNING.md` for dated learning notes and add new entries there when insights or discoveries happen.
- Keep the work scoped to the PyTorch warmup labs unless the user explicitly asks to explore other parts of the repo or add new projects.
- When proposing next steps, tie them back to the lab checklist (e.g., “finish Lab 0 training loop” or “start Lab 1 CNN shape tracking”).
- If uncertain what the user intends, ask for clarification rather than assuming, and include concrete references (file paths, lab names, dates) so the user can confirm.

## Persistence
- Whenever the user wants to reconfirm status, recheck the lab checkboxes in `projects/00_pytorch_warmup/README.md`.
- When significant progress is made (e.g., a lab fully checked), summarize it and remind the user to update the checklist and `LEARNING.md`.
