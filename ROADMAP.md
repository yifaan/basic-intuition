# ROADMAP

## Phase 0 — PyTorch refresh
- Rebuild fluency in training loops, checkpointing, and logging on toy classification tasks.

## Phase 1 — Object detection (robotics perception)
- Study detection losses, assignment strategies, and evaluation on small datasets using pretrained backbones.

## Phase 2 — Diffusion fundamentals
- Train a DDPM-style model on compact data to understand schedules and training dynamics.

## Phase 3 — Reinforcement learning basics
- Manually implement core RL algorithms on classic control environments while probing stability.

## Phase 4 — Active learning
- Explore pool-based selection strategies (uncertainty-driven vs random) for detection-style problems.

## Phase 5 — Gaussian splatting (exploratory)
- Experiment with 3D scene representations at small scale to build conceptual intuition.
