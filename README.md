# ML Learning Lab

This repository is a personal machine learning learning lab focused on robotics-relevant problems in perception, decision making, and data efficiency. Each project under `projects/` is kept small, self-contained, and centered on understanding training dynamics using handcrafted PyTorch loops, losses, and metrics.

## Structure
- `projects/` — Phase-aligned folders (PyTorch warmup through Gaussian splatting) that can evolve independently.
- `ROADMAP.md` — High-level goals for each phase.
- `LEARNING.md` — Living log of experiments, surprises, and lessons.

Use git history to chronicle progress and keep abstractions minimal until repetition justifies them.
