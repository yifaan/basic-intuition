# Phase 5 — Gaussian Splatting / 3D Representation (Exploratory)

## Objective
Build intuition for modern 3D scene representations relevant to robotics.

## Scope
- Conceptual understanding first
- Small-scale experiments if feasible
- No requirement for full reproduction

## Key concepts to learn
- Scene representation choices
- Optimization-based rendering
- Relationship to mapping and reconstruction

## Done when
- You can explain the method end-to-end
- You understand where it fits relative to NeRFs and SLAM-style pipelines

## Action items
- Read one introductory resource and summarize it here.
- Sketch the pipeline stages in a short diagram or bullet list.
- If feasible, run a tiny demo and log observations in `LEARNING.md`.
