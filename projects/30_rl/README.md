# Phase 3 — Reinforcement Learning Basics

## Objective
Learn RL fundamentals and common failure modes.

## Scope
- Classic control environments
- Small neural networks
- Simple state spaces (not large vision-based RL yet)

## Key concepts to learn
- Rewards and credit assignment
- Value functions vs policy gradients
- Exploration vs exploitation
- Instability and variance in training

## Done when
- Can solve at least one classic control task
- Can explain why training is unstable or slow
- Understand how reward design affects behavior

## Action items
- Choose one classic control task (e.g., CartPole).
- Implement a baseline algorithm (e.g., REINFORCE or DQN) from scratch.
- Track reward curves and failure modes over runs.
- Add a short note on reward shaping experiments.
